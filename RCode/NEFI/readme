creating a file for any notes on these scripts that we'd like to archive...

run_bayes_model.R: Allows user to input dates, site, and time intervals to run a model of interest and automatically save output. To-do's include inputting initial conditions, getting another set of eyes on the model code and predictions code, completing the temperature models including deciding on structure for the changepoint model, deciding on a number of iterations, and running all the models! 

Useful functions.Rmd: uses the curve function to make example plots of several commonly used functional forms for ecological modeling. 
You can alter the parameters and range over which the function is plotted to get a sense of how it would behave with your data. :)

bayes_models.R: collection of different models written with JAGs code

get_data.R: function that pulls in gloeo data and water temp data and puts in correct date time format

model_wrapper.R: script where you specify the calibration start /end dates, forecast end date, and sites at which you want to predict gloeo. The script calls the 
  driver data and runs the model you choose for your calibration time period. It will then iteratively forecast as each new observation comes on line. 

create_gif.R: creates a gif to plot gloeo forecast through time as an animation

plot_frames.R: plot individual frames at each forecasted time point for gif creation 

Plots.R: 

bloom_or_bust.R: script written by JAB and IM July 2018 to play with models and start adding in water temp as covariate. may merge with other scripts

zero_inflate_poission_example_JAGS.r: Example script written by Colin Averill July 2018 to provide an example of a blended zero inflated poission model with the JAGs code

zero_inflate_poission_example_JAGS_MEL.r: Modifying Colin's script to include randomly simulated air and water temperature covariates. Model 
results presented to GLEON group on Nov. 2, 2018. 

zero_inflate_poission_example_JAGS_MEL_WB_Seasonal.r: Modifying Colin's script to include seasonally simulated air temperature, water temperature,
and day length covariates.
