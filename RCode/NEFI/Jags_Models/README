ChangepointTempExp.R - not functional, waiting on water temperature data calibrations

Exponential.R - functional, but unsure if "lambda" should be "log(lamdba)" 

Logistic.R - functional, but unsure if lambda should be "log(lambda)"; should we implement better priors by calculating betas using r and k?

RandomYearIntercept.R - functional, changed original workshop code so x[i] is a function of mu[i-1] not x[i-1]; MEL: confused by this because code still has x[i] as function of x[i-1] and that seems right to me, actually

RandomYear.R - functional, changed original January Cary code so x[i] is a function of mu[i-1] not x[i-1]; MEL: confused by this because code still has x[i] as function of x[i-1] and that seems right to me, actually

ChangepointDOY.R - Shannon code from January Cary workshop

DayLengthQuad - functional

DayLength.R - functional

RandomWalk.R - functional

RandomWalkOOS.R - not functional, beginning of code for model selection based on out of sample data

DayLengthOOS.R - not functional, beginning of code for model selection based on out of sample data

TempQuad.R - not functional because of missing data; ready to go once buoy data used to calculate missing sensor data

TempExp.R - not functional because of missing data; ready to go once buoy data used to calculate missing sensor data

RandomWalkZip.R - functional
