ChangepointTempExp.R - not functional, waiting on water temperature data calibrations

Exponential.R - functional, but unsure if "lambda" should be "log(lamdba)"; included on EFI poster

Exponential_RandomYear - functional; included on EFI poster

Logistic.R - blows up when you try to run it (likely going to values too large for rjags to handle); planning to change to a Ricker model as recommended by Leah Johnson at VT

RandomYearIntercept.R - functional, changed original workshop code so x[i] is a function of mu[i-1] not x[i-1]; MEL: confused by this because code still has x[i] as function of x[i-1] and that seems right to me, actually

RandomYear.R - functional, changed original January Cary code so x[i] is a function of mu[i-1] not x[i-1]; MEL: confused by this because code still has x[i] as function of x[i-1] and that seems right to me, actually
included on EFI poster

ChangepointDOY.R - Shannon code from January Cary workshop

DayLengthQuad - functional; included on EFI poster; 01JUL19 added random year effect

DayLength.R - functional; included on EFI poster; 01JUL19 added random year effect

RandomWalk.R - functional; included on EFI poster

RandomWalkOOS.R - not functional, beginning of code for model selection based on out of sample data

DayLengthOOS.R - not functional, beginning of code for model selection based on out of sample data

Temperature.R - functional, working with air temperature data right now because can't have missing values for water temperature; included on EFI poster
added random year effect 12JUN19

TempQuad.R - not functional because of missing data; ready to go once buoy data used to calculate missing sensor data; included on EFI poster; 01JUL19 added random year effect

TempExp.R - not functional because of missing data; ready to go once buoy data used to calculate missing sensor data

RandomWalkZip.R - functional
