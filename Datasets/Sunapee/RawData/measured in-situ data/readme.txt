This file is for use in the GLEON Bayesian Modeling Workshop December 2017. The data are not for further distribution and shall not be used for any other purpose without first contacting Kathleen Weathers (weathersk@caryinstitute.org) and her colleagues.

--measured in-situ data: these are data from the monthly(ish) visits to two of the four sites (midge and newbury) included in the data set.

This file is a subset of the Lake Sunapee Protective Association's Longterm Monitoring Program database. Only two of their monitoring sites are close to the gloeo sampling sites, 110 (Midge) and 90 (Newbury).

See the file for data details.
